## 🚀 What's This All About?

Bears Classifier is a demo project showcasing a bear image classifier trained on the ResNet18 dataset using fastai. Upload photos of bears and let our model identify whether it's a grizzly, black, or polar bear. This demo is built to run smoothly in your browser and is deployed with GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I kept things simple, and crafted this bear classifier with:

- **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality
- **HTML**: Structuring our web content
- **CSS**: Styling to make the interface clean and user-friendly
- **FastAI**: For training the deep learning model with minimal code complexity, chosen for its abstractions for training and fine-tuning neural networks.
- **ResNet18**: Deep residual learning model known for its efficiency and performance in image classification tasks.
- **Hugging Face**: To deploy the model and make it accessible via a web interface, we used Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🏋️‍♂️ How It Works
- Data Collection: leveraged Kaggle's bear image dataset, which includes labeled images of grizzly, black, and polar bears.
- Model Training: Using FastAI's high-level API, we trained a ResNet18 model to classify bear images, employing transfer learning techniques to speed up the process and improve accuracy.
- Deployment: The trained model is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, ensuring easy integration and real-time classification in the browser.
